## Overview

This repository contains a simple web scraper implemented in [insert programming language here, e.g., Python]. It is designed to demonstrate basic web scraping techniques, including:

- Fetching HTML content from a website
- Parsing and extracting specific data using libraries such as [e.g., BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Puppeteer]
- Saving extracted data to a local file or database

**Please note:** This scraper is not intended for use in production or for scraping data without the explicit permission of the website owner.

## Important Notes

- **Respect website rules:** Always check the site's robots.txt file and adhere to its guidelines. Automated scraping can place undue strain on servers and may result in legal or technical consequences.
- **Rate-limiting and delays:** The script includes rate-limiting features to reduce the risk of overloading the target website. Modify these settings cautiously.
- **Proxy and user-agent settings:** To demonstrate basic techniques, the scraper includes examples of setting user-agents and proxies. Use them responsibly and within legal bounds.
